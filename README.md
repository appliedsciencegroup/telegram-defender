<img src="./images/telegram_defender_wide.png" width="100%" height="">

Telegram Defender can be added to any channel or group. It will automatically scan links that get posted for malware, and will remove them if detected. It can also tell you more about the media source (look in settings for more information). Feel free to submit any ideas or code contributions!

**NOTE: This does not guarantee in any way that you will be proteced from malware.**

#### Set up your bot with the Botfather
<img src="./images/botfather.jpg" width="25%" height="">

1. In Telegram, start a conversation with the @botfather. [More information can be founder here](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
2. Type `/newbot` into the telegram conversation.
3. Give your bot a name, as well as a username. This is what people will use to find it.

When succesful, it will look something like this

```
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at https://t.me/teledefconbot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
98379:AAHaFDqDrnW6lgzXxLftk6cnU1733yaYhP9yyUQ (*note: this is a fake key)
Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api

### Create an Avira URL Safety Cloud scanner:
1. Go here: `https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Avira-Avira-URL-Safety-Cloud/B079C6B7LL`
2. You'll need to subscribe to this service via [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
3. Once that's complete, go here `https://developer.protection-services.avira.com/apis`
    - You should see: **Avira URL Safety Cloud** Entrypoint: `https://nihh1mvy78.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/url-query`
    Save this URL for later.
    - Click `show api key` to get your api key. Save that for later too.

# Deployment
> Here are steps to get your own version of Telegram Defender online. 
> This is for people who have inspected the code and want to run it themselves.


## Configure your bot on Telegram

 1. Create a new Channel
    - Give it a name
    - Public vs Private
    - Admins
    - Add "TelegramDefender" bot

2. To set the user pic, start a chat with @Botfather
    - Enter `/setuserpic`
    - Select the name of your bot
    - Send the photo


## Deploying your bot to a server
3. Create a new server that's running Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
> The commands below should be pasted in one at a time. We're installing different repositories for the application to download what it needs.

    - run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
    - run `sudo apt-get update`
    - run `sudo apt-get install`
    - run `sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools`
    - run `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`
    - run `sudo apt-get install python3.8`
    - run `sudo apt install python3.8-venv python3.8-dev`


4. Go to your root directory.
    - You should already be in your root directory, if not `cd ~` will take you there.
    - Clone Telegram Defender to your local server with `git clone https://github.com/yalefox/telegram-defender.git`


5. Set Python 3.8 as default
> We need to use Python 3.8 in order to work with Avira. Here, we're creating a virtual environment to run our software.

    - Go to your root folder with `cd ~`
    - Create a new directory with `mkdir venvs`
    - Open it with `cd venvs`
    - Run `python3.8 -m venv tdenv`
    - Run `source tdenv/bin/activate`


6. Install dependencies
    - enter `cd ~/telegram-defender/bot`
    - run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
        - you may see this warning, but it's okay to ignore it. 
```
WARNING: You are using pip version 19.2.3, however version 19.3.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

7. Update your tokens
    - enter `nano ~/telegram-defender/bot/json/token.json` to create a new file
    - Replace the API keys below with the ones you got earlier. The URL should be the same. 
    - Press `Ctrl + X` to save and exit.

```
{
    "bot_token": "XXXXXXXX",
    "avira_token": "XXXXXXXX",
    "avira_url": "https://nihh1mvy78.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/url-query"
}
```


8. Now we need to update the service
    - run `apt-get install systemd`
    > This will restart the bot if it goes down.
    - enter `cd /etc/systemd/system`
    - enter `nano bot.service`

9. Copy the following code and enter `Ctrl + X` to exit and save.
 
```
[Unit]
Description=TelegramDefender
After=syslog.target
After=network.target
[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/telegram-defender/bot
ExecStart=/root/venvs/tdenv/bin/python /root/telegram-defender/bot/bot.py
RestartSec=10
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

10. Run this 4 command to deploy the bot.
    - run `systemctl daemon-reload` 
    - run `systemctl enable bot`
    - run `systemctl start bot`
    - run `systemctl status bot`

If succesful, you should see something that looks like this:
```
● bot.service - TelegramDefender
        Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/bot.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
        Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-09-11 14:18:54 UTC; 3s ago
    Main PID: 8345 (python3)
        Tasks: 4 (limit: 1152)
        CGroup: /system.slice/bot.service
                └─8345 /usr/bin/python3 /root/telegram-defender/bot/bot.py
```

That's it! You're ready to go!
